Hence using --clobber and specifying a model input (structure file) doesn't cooperate properly. It simply writes over (or creates a new file) with that filename regardless of what was there before.\n\nThere is no code fix planned for this. This issue can be worked around by not using --clobber when custom inputs are requested. The only downside being is on re-runs having to remove or change your output work directory.\n\nThe documentation will be updated and the commit will be referenced here.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>The issue here is with the --clobber option used in the example provided and it's unclear functionality in this context.</p>\n<p>When specifying custom files for your model on the command line, segway will try to output to that filename (say for saving the structure to a specific file or directory) or use that file as input (for example training in this case) if the file already exists.</p>\n<p>However if the --clobber option is put out, it assumes that the files specified on the command line are supposed to be outputs that need to be overwritten regardless of what's already there.
