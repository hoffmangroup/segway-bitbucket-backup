This means that Segway will partition the input observations into fixed windows of size res and perform inference on the mean of the observation averaged along the fixed window. This can result in a large speedup at the cost of losing the highest possible precision. However, if you are considering data that is only generated at a low resolution to start with, this can be an appealing option.```\n\nSo I thought it would be less confusing if I followed the same convention.
